# VisuFlow

In functional programming, we decouple the data from the functionality.  
But why don't we decouple the data flow from the functions?  
...
A Clojure library designed to help you organize the order of your functions.

## Usage

### Ingredients - a small overview...
For this to work, you need functions you want to link together.

Then you need some kind of "state" you want to pass through.

Most likely you'll need a map of *validargs*.
Validargs are keywords referring to a "testing scheme". More on that later.

Finally, you need a nested structure describing what you want to do.

To start, do:
```clojure
(use 'visuflow.core)
(walk {:state 5 :tree '(... walking tree ...) :validargs {... validarg map ...})
```

### The nested structure
The nested structure describes how your data flows through your functions:
Lists hold everything together:
```clojure
'(first [:!f identity :true] ([println true]) ([println false]))
```
If a list entry consists of more than one thing, you wrap them in a vector:
```clojure
[:!fp #(inc %) :data]
```
Finally, a sub-structure is again a list:
```clojure
(:mapkey)
```

### Calling functions and keywords - The result stack
VisuFlow tries to intelligently use the args your embedded function takes.
First, an important thing: Throughout a walk, VisuFlow keeps all results in a stack-like structure.
That is implemented as a Clojure list using conj, take and drop.

At first, the stack only contains the "state" you passed in. Then, after each function call
the result gets put on top of it.

*What has this to do with the arity of your functions?*
That's simple: Passing in a one-arg function, VisuFlow hands it the topmost value of the stack.
Passing in a two-arg function, it gets the two topmost args, and so on. Until you run out of stack.

#### The :!p keyword
Look at this example code:
```clojure
;; We assume the stack is (7 6 5 4 3 2 1)
(defn increment [x] (inc x))
(defn addition [x y] (+ x y))

[:!p increment] ;;=> (8 6 5 4 3 2 1)
[:!p addition] ;;=> (13 5 4 3 2 1)

increment ;;=> (8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1)
addition ;;=> (13 7 6 5 4 3 2 1)
```
The p in :!p stands for "pop", which means "take the first value from the stack and remove it".
At the end of each function call, the result gets put back.

### Fork - If, the VisuFlow way
When you need to decide which function to execute next, you need to fork your way.
This is done using fork statements:
```clojure
[:!f #(inc %) :data]
```
The fork statement consists of three elements.

1. The keyword to distinguish it: :!f means "fork", and :!fp means fork, but pop the values taken for the function from the stack.

2. The validator: A function which gets applied just as the others in the data flow.

3. A "validarg": A keyword telling VisuFlow how to interpret the result of the validator.

#### Validargs
There are some built-in validargs:
:data "if input is a value other than true, false, nil"
:true "if input is true"
:false "if input is false"
:nil "if input is nil"
:fnil "if input is false or nil"
:is "A vector query like above with custom checkers."	

Furthermore you can define your own in the validargs-map you have to supply at the beginning:
```clojure
{:type [[map? 1]
        [list? 2]
	    [vector? 3]
	    [:else 4]]}
```
It looks like a sub-flow. Each vector specifies an if-then statement.
First, on the left side you can have anything that's a function and takes one argument,
or :else.

On the right side you have more options:

1. Numbers: Tells the walker how much to drop from the list it's walking on. The walker can only ever work on the first element of the list. 0 means: Run the fork again.  

2. A keyword: Tells the walker: Drop one and continue at the list at the map value of the keyword.
If no map is found, the walker will look if the first element of the list is equal to the keyword.  

3. Chaining: You can chain numbers and keywords together in a sequence.
e.g. [3 :foo] means: Drop three and continue as in 2., with the exception that no more entries will be dropped. :foo is an implicit [1 :foo].  

### More control - the :! colonbangs (unimplemented)
```clojure
:!p ;; *P*op instead of peek the values on the stack
:!f ;; *F*ork the way
:!fp ;; *F*ork the way, *p*op the stack
:!_#n ;; Clean the stack and only keep the last n values
:!d#n ;; *D*rop n: This overrules the normal (drop 1) after every command
:!q ;; *Q*uit the flow and return the last result (NOT RECOMMENDED!)
```

## TODO List
* Do something useful when the element is neiter a keyword, function, nor a list.
* Implement the :! keyword functionality (:!f :!p and :!fp work)
* Check first element of list instead of only the map
* -Something I forgot belongs here-
